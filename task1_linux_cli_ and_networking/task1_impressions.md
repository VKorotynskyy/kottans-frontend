## Linux CLI, and HTTP impressions

1. Linux CLI
   1. I use CLI everyday. Especially navigation (```cd```), creation (```touch, mkdir```) and lookup (```grep```). 
      But many things I didn't know or do not use frequently like piping, redirection. ```sed``` was totally new for me.
   2. Was surprised mostly with ```sed``` command, and possibility to use aliases and env variables. I like there is a 
      possibility to change terminal lay out, for instance to change propmpt ```export PS1=">> "```.
   3. Will definetely use knowlledge about aliases and other settings for comfortable work in cli. Aswell as other 
      features I knew from the material.
2. HTTP
   1. In general it's one of the weakest spots for front-end devs. We know in general, but not in depth. I found out
      about of types of headers, never heard about entity headers, and so on.
   2. I'm not sure wat was surprising for me, but I definitely got smth about cache and auth.
   3. I will implement knowllege in my fetch requests (additionals headers) and will set cache to lower quantity of requests.
