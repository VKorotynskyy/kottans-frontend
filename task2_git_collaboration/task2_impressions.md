## VCS (hello gitty), GitHub and Collaboration
1. Version control
   1. I learned some flags and commands I never used before, like ```git remote prune origin --dry-run``` or ```git branch -a```.
   2. Was surprised by ```git rebase -i HEAD~3```, wich squashes last 3 commits. Now i know the difference between ```git revert``` and ```git reset```.
   3. Sure I will be use in my work any usefull technique I've learned from this material, like ```git log -p```.
2. GitHub & Collaboration
   1. ```git remote add upstream``` was new to me,  and staying in sync with forked repository.
   2. ```git rebase``` is definitely something surprising for me.
   3. Will use everything I've learned, because it's vital for current dev flow with distributed teams.
