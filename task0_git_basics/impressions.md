## Git impressions

1. I use git on a daily basis, so I didn't learn to much from this intro course. Hence,
   I recollected some materials and found out about some new tricks and commands I do not usually use.
2. ```git cherry-pick``` is something that can impress everyone.
3. Hope will master```Git rebase``` and ```git cherry-pick``` and will use it with ease.
